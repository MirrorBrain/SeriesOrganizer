It has been implemented to recognize the naming pattern of PSA rips series.

Example :
Marvel's.Agents.of.S.H.I.E.L.D.S03E01.720p.HDTV.2CH.x265.HEVC-PSA.mkv

The series name in first, followed by the season after a S, followed by the episode number after a E.

It will recognize the name of the serie and search for the season after the serie's name and between a S and a E. The rest of the name can be whatever you want, as long as the previous naming rules are followed it will arrange your series correctly.
